* BatteryTech General Overview
*
**********************************

1. What is BatteryTech?

BT (BatteryTech) is comprised of source code and projects for IDEs.  It is a platform designed for developing mobile games and high-performance apps.  The source code includes everything needed to perform high level functions such as reading a JPG from disk, decoding it to a bitmap and uploading the bitmap into VRAM using OpenGL.  This may seem like a trivial task but to be able to do it effortless across different operating systems which use different languages and methods of packing up the data is something that shouldn't be underestimated.  BT enables exactly that sort of cross-platform behavior which will be mostly seamless to your app so long as you develop with a cross-platform mentality.  

2. What is in the source?

2a. audio - See BatteryTech - Audio.txt for an overview of the audio subsystem
2b. decoders - The lightest-weight decoders available for JPG, PNG, GIF, OGG and TTF.  These decoders take these file formats and decode them into usable structures.  Images are decoded to bitmap suitable for use with OpenGL and direct manipulation.  OGG is decoded to raw PCM suitable for audio mixing and playback.  TTFs are rasterized to a bitmap for use with OpenGL.
2c. network - See BatteryTech - Network.txt for network discussion
2d. platform - Cross platform includes and platform-specific implementations of GL and general functions.
2e. render - Tools for rendering menus and text using OpenGL.
2f. ui - See BatteryTech - UI.txt for an overview of the UI library
2g. util - General-purpose utilities.

3. Projects

Because there is no standalone BT (it's a library and the base of an application), projects are provided for a demo app for all supported targets.  Cross platform developers need to know enough about each IDE they are using to be able to configure a project with all desired parameters to produce the correct output.  Much of this is done for the demo app projects included with BT, however there are often specific parameters that are environment-dependent that need to be set before the build will succeed.  See BatteryTech - IDEs and Environments.txt for more info.

4. Demo App

The Demo App provided is a basic 2D physics demo using Box2D.  Box2D is open source software and the license is included in the base of the source tree for it.  Newer versions may be available at box2d.org, however they often require modification to build for all environments.  The Demo App shows how to set up a basic game class structure using BT.  It also shows how to use menus, sounds, accelerometer and play streaming music.  It is an excellent place to start a new project as much of the key componentry needed is in place to begin prototyping a game.

5. Documentation

Please read through all of the files included in the documentation directory.  All code also has descriptions on the top and if it's a public API class (not only meant for internal use), it will have comments in the header file for functions and usage.
